Working through TOP Ruby assignments in Python

I already know Python reasonably well and don't feel like learning Ruby, so I'm gonna try to roughly follow The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails track but replace RoR with Python and Django.

merge_sort.py - Implement a merge sort algorithm

linked_list.py - Implement a linked list data structure using Python classes

tree.py - Implement a binary search tree data structure using Python classes

knight_moves.py - Implement a BFS algorithm to find the shortest path between any two squares on a chessboard using the movements available to a knight
