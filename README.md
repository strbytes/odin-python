Working through TOP Ruby assignments in Python

I already know Python reasonably well and don't feel like learning Ruby, so I'm gonna try to roughly follow The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails track but replace RoR with Python and Django.

Exercises - Some of the basic exercises from TOP's Ruby section, completed in Python

Testing - The exercises from TOP's Ruby section devoted to Test-Driven Development
