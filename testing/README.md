Testing

calc.py and test_calc.py - Experiment with Pytest to make sure I understand its basic functionality

caesar.py and test_caesar.py - Experiment with using Test-Driven Development to implement a simple function. Tests borrowed from https://github.com/TheOdinProject/javascript-exercises/blob/main/13_caesar/caesar.spec.js and re-implemented in Pytest.

tictactoe.py and test_tictactoe.py - More complicated (but still simple) project for practicing Test-Driven Development.
